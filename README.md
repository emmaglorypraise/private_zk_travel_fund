# ZK Private Travel Fund Splitter 
## Project Overview

The Private Travel Fund Splitter is a zero-knowledge dApp that lets a group of friends contribute privately to a shared travel fundâ€”without revealing how much each person paid. Everyone can see the total amount, but individual contributions remain private. This project showcases how the Miden WebClient SDK brings privacy-preserving features to real-world use cases.

It's a great demo of combining transparency and privacy using zero-knowledge proofs and notes, making it perfect for collective payment scenarios like travel, events, or crowdfunding.
